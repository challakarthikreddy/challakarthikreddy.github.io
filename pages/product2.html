                <p>PAOS is a web application to predict the daily requirement of re-sellers on the basis of HML algorithm. This algorithm was developed by NEC Labs. 
                The PAOS application takes 365 days records of sold product and on the basis of that it calculates the prediction. Internally PAOS runs an executor as a daemon service to get the prediction. It gives 850 predictions and with the help of 365 days 
                records we have to find out the closest prediction which is finally stored in database. </p>
                <p>The 365 days records are supplied by the re-seller and on the basis of final prediction output, re-seller finds out, 
                    how much groceries he should order for a particular day.</p>
